## Creating a New Project

To start a new Node.js project:

```bash
# Create a project directory
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Initialize NPM (creates package.json)
npm init

# For default values, use -y flag
npm init -y
```

The `package.json` file is the heart of your Node.js project. It contains:
- Project metadata (name, version, description)
- Dependencies list
- Scripts for automation
- License information

## Installing Packages

### Local vs. Global Installation

```bash
# Local installation (default)
npm install lodash

# Global installation
npm install -g nodemon
```

**Local installation** adds packages to your project's `node_modules` folder and records them in `package.json`.

**Global installation** makes packages available system-wide as command-line tools.

### Installing Specific Versions

```bash
# Install specific version
cls

# Install latest version
npm install lodash@latest
```

### Using --save and --save-dev Flags

```bash
# Production dependency (--save is default in npm 5+)
npm install axios lodash

# Development dependency
npm install --save-dev nodemon
# Or shorter syntax
npm install -D nodemon
```

**Production dependencies** are required to run your application.

**Development dependencies** are only needed during development (testing, building, etc.).

## NPM Version Ranges

Version ranges control how npm handles updates when running `npm update`:

### ^ (Caret) - Default for npm install

```json
"dependencies": {
  "axios": "^2.3.4"
}
```

- Allows updates to **minor and patch** versions
- Example: `^2.3.4` allows updates to any version from 2.3.4 up to (but not including) 3.0.0
- Best for most dependencies as it automatically gets bug fixes and new features without breaking changes

### ~ (Tilde)

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "~4.17.1"
}
```

- Allows only **patch** updates
- Example: `~2.3.4` allows updates to any version from 2.3.4 up to (but not including) 2.4.0
- More conservative approach when you want bug fixes but no new features

### * (Asterisk)

```json
"dependencies": {
  "some-package": "*"
}
```

- Wildcard that matches **any** version
- Example: `*` - latest version, `2.*.*` - any version starting with 2
- Very risky for production as it could introduce breaking changes

### Exact Version (no symbol)

```json
"dependencies": {
  "moment": "2.29.1"
}
```

- Locks to exactly this version
- Most restrictive but safest option for critical dependencies

## NPM Scripts

NPM scripts provide a way to automate common tasks and commands:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js",
  "test": "jest",
  "lint": "eslint ."
}
```

Run scripts using:

```bash
# Run the start script
npm start

# Run other scripts with "run"
npm run dev
npm run test
npm run lint
```

### Built-in Scripts

Some script names are special and don't require the `run` command:
- `npm start` - Start your application
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm stop` - Stop your application

### Custom Scripts

You can define any script name and chain commands:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build-and-start": "npm run build && npm start",
  "clean": "rm -rf node_modules"
}
```

## Practical Examples

### Installing a Common Set of Packages

```bash
# Install production dependencies
npm install axios lodash express

# Install development dependencies
npm install --save-dev nodemon jest eslint
```

### Understanding package-lock.json

The `package-lock.json` file:
- Ensures consistent installations across environments
- Records the exact version of each installed dependency
- Should be committed to version control

### Node Modules Best Practices

- Never commit `node_modules` to version control
- Always include both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules`
