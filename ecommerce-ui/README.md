# React Product Management App

A simple React application for managing products, built with Vite, React Router, and Axios.

## Project Setup Guide

### Creating a New Project

1. **Install Node.js**
   
   Make sure you have Node.js (version 14.18+ or 16+) installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a new Vite React project**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-product-app --template react
   ```

   Replace `my-product-app` with your preferred project name.

3. **Navigate to your project directory**

   ```bash
   cd my-product-app
   ```

4. **Install base dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Installing Required Packages

1. **Install React Router DOM**

   For handling routing in the application:

   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

2. **Install Axios**

   For making API requests:

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```

### Starting the Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is already in use).
